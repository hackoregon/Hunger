Proposed README file for the project repository.


All Hack Oregon projects are open source projects. We want everything we do to be understandable, auditable, reproducible, findable and runnable. Let’s keep things together!


The DevOps team is focused on making things easier for us all.  That’s especially so for future cycles of this project.


Code is stored on Github. Hack Oregon has its own github repository. The Hunger project is a branch off of the main Hack Oregon repository (in a branch called hackoregon/hunger), not in your personal repository. For the Hunger team the front and back end repositories are together.  That’s a DevOps requirement. Docker containers will be built for your ease of use on this project.


Documentation is essential for this project.  We will draft it on our Google Drive and then push it to Github. Both Google drive and Github can be linked to our slack channel.


DevOps will provide you with a framework, Docker containers and test suite.  Currently the front end is Javascript React. Back end is a Postgres database using Python for the api.  Hack Oregon communicates with teams on Slack. You will be invited to the appropriate Slack channel.


Yes there are other stacks. We want to keep things simple and standardized, so that your time is spent on learning and developing not reinventing the wheel.
